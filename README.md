# Basic trie implementation

This is a minimal implementation of a trie in C++. It was created as an exercise and not meant to be used in real software.

* `trie.h` and `trie.cpp` contains the interface and implementations of the trie.
* `main.cpp` contains a simple test of the trie's operations.

## Build instructions

    make
    make example

Running the code above inside the source directory will compile the program and demonstrate the basic operations of the implemented trie. The compile executable will be called `prog`.
