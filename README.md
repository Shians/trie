# Basic trie implementation

This is a minimal implementation of a trie in C++. It was created as an exercise and not meant to be used in real software.

* `trie.h` and `trie.cpp` contains the interface and implementations of the trie.
* `main.cpp` contains a simple test of the trie's operations.

## Build instructions

    g++ -std=c++11 -o prog main.cpp trie.cpp
    ./prog

Running the code above inside the source directory will demonstrate the basic operations of the implemented trie.
